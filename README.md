Android applicaiton containing welcome message. 

Underneath there are two buttons. The top one calls
activity (text editor). Once the user starts the text
editor, he/she types in text. I implented Pattern Matcher
which is looking for a phone number in the format:
(888)888-8888, (888) 888-8888 or 888-8888.
if a phone number is found it calls the dialer. 
When the text editor is done it sends back a result
to the main activity.


When the user presses the bottom button a browser is 
opened and android page is loaded.
